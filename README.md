# Data Science Intern Assignment Submission

This repository contains my submission for the Data Science Intern assignment. It includes three tasks: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), a Lookalike Model (using LSH), and Customer Segmentation (using Spectral Clustering).

## Key Features
1. **EDA**: Uncovering meaningful patterns and trends in customer and transaction data.
2. **Lookalike Model**: Recommending similar customers based on profile and transaction history using **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** with Jaccard similarity.
3. **Clustering**: Segmenting customers into groups for better-targeted strategies using **Spectral Clustering**.
